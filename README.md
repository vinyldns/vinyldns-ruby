# VinylDNS-Ruby

Ruby gem for working with VinylDNS.

* It was built around [the API](https://www.vinyldns.io/api/)
* It relies, currently, on the AWS-SDK to sign the HTTP requests it makes

# Requirements

1. Ruby ~> 2.4
2. ```ENV['VINYLDNS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']``` & ```ENV['VINYLDNS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']``` are set in your application or local shell
    * You can find both of these within the portal by downloading your credentials file
3. ```ENV['VINYLDNS_API_URL']``` is set with your api url (if applicable include http[s]:// and port)

# Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'vinyldns-ruby'
```

# Usage

Add this require to your code:

```ruby
require 'vinyldns/api'
```

# Getting Started

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior

* Each method returns a JSON object
* The methods request an 'api_request_object' with the HTTP Method specified like: ```Vinyldns::API.new('get')```, then perform a variation of ```Vinyldns::API.make_request(api_request_object, "zones/#{zone_id}")```
* Method parameters match the HTTP Request Parameter requirements in the API. See the [API Reference](https://www.vinyldns.io/api/) for more information.
* SSL verification is enabled by default; `ENV['VINYLDNS_VERIFY_SSL']` can be set to false in order to disable.

## Contributing

If you decide to contribute, please read over our [contributor documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Namespaces and Methods

* Arguments to methods, take Vinyldns::API::Zone.get(id) as an example, can be a little confusing at first. All arguments used under a method that are not explicit, like in our example *id*, can be understood as *zone_id* due to it existing under the namespace ::Zone.

## Simple Example (Pull first zone you have access to)

* Requires you to have at least one zone for your user/group

        [1] pry(main)> require 'vinyldns/api'
        => true
        [2] pry(main)> Vinyldns::API::Zone.search()
        => {"zones"=>
          [{"name"=>"XXXXXXX.yourdomain.net.",
            "email"=>"XXXXX@yourdomain.com",
            "status"=>"Active",
            "created"=>"2017-11-27T17:06:53Z",
            "updated"=>"2018-01-30T13:56:55Z",
            "id"=>"92cXXXXX3b67a",
            "connection"=>{"name"=>"XXXXXXX.yourdomain.net.", "keyName"=>"_t&p-@yourdomain.com", "key"=>"OBe0nmlA==", "primaryServer"=>"XX.rXXXX.yourdomain.net"},
            "account"=>"system",
            "shared"=>false,
            "acl"=>{"rules"=>[{"accessLevel"=>"Delete", "groupId"=>"15e073b7119c", "recordTypes"=>["A", "NS", "SPF", "AAAA", "SSHFP", "CNAME", "SRV", "PTR", "TXT", "MX"]}]},
            "adminGroupId"=>"ac1",
            "latestSync"=>"2017-12-04T19:35:53Z"}],
         "maxItems"=>5}


## All Available Methods  

* Below method arguments with "=" next to them indicate a default value. You do not have to specify "argmuentX = nil', just know if you don't set it nil will be used.

### Vinyldns::API

    - new(method, region = 'us-east-1', api_url = ENV['VINYLDNS_API_URL'], content_type = 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded')
       - Required for make_request, but not before any of the Vinyldns::API::* methods.

    - make_request(signed_object, uri, body = '')
       - HTTP requests that fail are returned as: ```#<Net::HTTPUnauthorized 401 Unauthorized readbody=true>```

### Vinyldns::API::Zone

    - connect(name, distribution_email, group_id = nil, group_name_filter = nil)
        - "Connects user to an existing zone. User must be a member of the group that has access to the zone."
        - name must be the full zone name you wish to connect to. For example: ingest.yourdomain.net instead of ingest.
        - Will use group_id and ignore group_name_filter if group_id is set.
        - If group_id is nil and group_name_filter is set, it will run Vinyldns::API::Group.list_my_groups and use the ID of the group it finds.
        - group_name_filter searches must return only 1 entry else it will error, so be specific.

    - update(id, request_params)
        - Zone API Reference > Zone Model details all available options
        - request_params must be a hash of values permitted by the API. See the API reference linked to above.
        - Updates are NOT immediate.

    - delete(id)

    - get(id)

    - search(name_filter = nil, max_items = 5, start_from = nil)
        - If name_filter is not set, it will pull an alphabetical list of zones you have access to.

    - sync(id)

    - history(id)

    - list_changes(id, max_items = 5, start_from = nil)

### Vinyldns::API::Zone::RecordSet

    - create(zone_id, name, type, ttl, records_array)
        - Suggested ttl is 900

    - update(zone_id, request_params)
        - request_params must be a hash of values permitted by the API. See the API reference linked to above.

    - delete(zone_id, id)

    - get(zone_id, id)

    - search(zone_id, name_filter = nil, max_items=10, start_from = nil, ignore_access)
        - If name_filter is not set, it will pull an alphabetical list of zones.
        - If ignore_access is true, it will return zones regardless of your access to them.

    - get_change(zone_id, id, change_id)
        - Use Vinyldns::API::Zone.list_changes to obtain change_id

### Vinyldns::API::Zone::BatchRecordChanges

    [No Zone ID needed for these]

    - create(changes_array, comments, owner_group_id, scheduled_time, allow_manual_review)
        - changes must be an array of Add or DeleteRecordSet hashes.
        - scheduled_time only allowed if manual batch change review and scheduled batch changes are supported in the VinylDNS instance
        - allow_manual_review default is true, can be set to false to fail rather than sending to review if there are soft errors in the batch change.

    - get(id)

    - user_recent(ignore_access, approvalStatus)
        - Summary information for the most recent 100 batch changes created by the user.
        - If ignore_access is true, it will return batch changes whether you created them or not. Filter only applies for VinylDNS super and support admins.
        - approval_status is a filter, can be one of AutoApproved, PendingReview, ManuallyApproved or Rejected.

    - cancel(id)
      - Requires manual batch change to be enabled in VinylDNS instance.
      - Only for the creator of the batch change.
      - Batch Change must have an approval status of PendingReview.

    - approve(id, review_comment)
      - Requires manual batch change to be enabled in VinylDNS instance.
      - For VinylDNS super and support admins only.
      - Batch Change must have an approval status of PendingReview.

    - reject(id, review_comment)
      - Requires manual batch change to be enabled in VinylDNS instance.

### Vinyldns::API::Group

    - create(name, distribution_email, members_array, admins_array, description = '')
        - members_array and admins_array must be included. Please see API reference linked to at the top of this readme.

        - request_params must be a hash of values permitted by the API. See the API reference linked to above.

    - delete(id)

    - get(id)

    - list_my_groups(name_filter = nil, max_items = 5, start_from = nil)
        - If name_filter is not set, it will pull an alphabetical list of zones you have access to.

    - list_group_admins(id)

    - list_group_members(id, max_items = 5, start_from = nil)
