## What should I know before I get started?

### Design Decisions

Following Ruby's DRY principle, we've created a method for making HTTP calls. This method allows us to pass in whatever we want but easily sign the requests for AWS.
We then followed the structure of the VinylDNS documentation as closely as possible, providing methods for all commonly performed VinylDNS API calls.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

When you are creating a bug report, fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md). The information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Provide the following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots if you can.**
* **If you're reporting that VinylDNS-Ruby crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. 

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of VinylDNS-Ruby are you using?** You can get the exact version by running `gem list | grep vinyldns-ruby` in your terminal.
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?

### Pull Requests
